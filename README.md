# Malware Behavior Documentation

This repo is where I document practical, hands-on demonstrations of how malware works — in a controlled lab setup. From Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to destructive viruses, each threat is broken down to understand its infection method, execution flow, and capabilities.

## Documented Threats

### 1. Trojan Attack (njRAT)
Used njRAT to gain full control of a victim machine via phishing. Covers setup, persistence, and feature usage through the RAT’s GUI. Full breakdown available in the Trojan folder.

### 2. Virus Attack (Coming Soon)
A walkthrough of how a Windows virus infects, spreads, and damages systems. Will include live behavior capture and mitigation notes.
